 - All project specific classes and structs follow the Unreal Engine relevant prefix with "Deck"
	ex.	class ADeckPlayerController
		class UDeckItem
		struct FDeckPlayerData

 - UENUMS are prefixed with "EDeck". however non-Unreal enums are enclosed within the namespace "EDeck" + enum name and the enum is then named "type"
